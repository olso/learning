# Setup

We need to setup workspace for dependency and imports resolution

This is a setup for fish shell + macos

`go env`

For GOPATH setup, look at https://github.com/olso/dotfiles/blob/master/config.fish

~~Install Go plugin for IntelliJ~~ http://jetbrains.com/go/

Anything Go related added by us will be in `$GOPATH`
